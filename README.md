## Usage

1. download and include [loading.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loadingio/loading.css/v2.0.0/dist/loading.min.css):

```
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="loading.css"/>
```

you an use a CDN, such as, from jsDelivr:

```
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/loadingio/loading.css@v2.0.0/dist/loading.min.css"/>
```



2. Check the [loading.css animation gallery](https://loading.io/animation/) for the animations you want to use. For example, say you want to use the `spin` animation 

3. Use the name as a CSS class prefixed with `ld` on the element you want to animate:

```
    <div class="ld ld-spin"></div>
```

4. For more information, check out [loading.css animation documentation](https://loading.io/animation/).


## Notice

Animations involving fliping ( e.g., rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ ) cause blinking glitches in Safari ( up to version 15.1 ). It's not a loading.css bug but a browser issue which is not yet solved.

A simple workaround is to wrap animated elements within a container with following style:

    transform: translate3d(0,0,0)

However this creates a stacking context and may not work well with fixed positioned elements.
